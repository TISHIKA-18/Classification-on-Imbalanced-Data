# 📊📈📉  Classification-on-Imbalanced-Data

## Introduction
In the realm of machine learning, classification tasks are ubiquitous, ranging from spam detection to medical diagnosis. However, one of the significant challenges faced by practitioners is dealing with imbalanced datasets. Imbalanced data refers to scenarios where the classes in the dataset are not represented equally, often leading to biased models that perform poorly for the minority class. In this blog, we’ll explore various techniques to handle imbalanced data using Python, ensuring your models are robust and reliable.

## Understanding Imbalanced Data
Imbalanced data occurs when one class significantly outnumbers the other. For example, in a fraud detection dataset, 95% of the transactions might be legitimate, while only 5% are fraudulent. A naive classifier might simply predict all transactions as legitimate to achieve high overall accuracy, but this approach would fail to identify fraud, which is the primary goal.

## Problem Statement
How can we effectively classify an imbalanced dataset where the target class is significantly underrepresented?

Imbalanced datasets are a common challenge in machine learning, particularly when one class (the minority class) is much less frequent than the other class (the majority class). This imbalance can lead to biased models that perform poorly on the minority class, which is often the class of greater interest. In this context, the dataset in question pertains to insurance claims data where the number of claims of a particular status (e.g., fraudulent or not) is disproportionately small compared to the other status.

## Challenges with Imbalanced Data
▶️ Biased Models: Models trained on imbalanced data often favor the majority class, leading to high accuracy but poor recall for the minority class.
▶️ Misleading Accuracy: Accuracy as a metric can be misleading; a model predicting the majority class will have high accuracy but won’t be useful.
▶️ Evaluation Metrics: Choosing the right evaluation metrics becomes crucial to gauge the true performance of the model.
